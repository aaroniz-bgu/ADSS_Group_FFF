# Services Package Documentation

## Overview

The "services" package contains service objects responsible for implementing the business logic of the application. These services orchestrate interactions between different components, handle complex operations, and enforce business rules.

## Purpose

### 1. Business Logic Implementation

Services encapsulate the application's business logic, including data processing, validation, and coordination of domain objects. They abstract away the details of data access and provide a high-level interface for interacting with the application's functionality.

## Importance of Defining Interfaces

It is crucial to define interfaces for services before creating their implementations. Interfaces serve as contracts that define the methods and behavior expected from service implementations. They establish a clear API for interacting with services, enabling loose coupling and promoting adherence to the Dependency Inversion Principle.

## Naming Convention

The naming convention for interfaces and their implementations typically follows the pattern:

- Interface: `{ServiceName}Service`
- Implementation: `{ServiceName}ServiceImpl`

For example:
- Interface: `UserService`
- Implementation: `UserServiceImpl`

## Example

Consider a UserService interface and its implementation:

```java
package com.example.services;

public interface UserService {
    UserDTO getUserById(Long id);
    UserDTO createUser(CreateUserRequest request);
    // Other service methods...
}
```
