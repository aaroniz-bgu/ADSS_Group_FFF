# Models Package Documentation

## Overview

The "domain.models" package contains definitions for domain model objects. These objects represent the core entities or business objects within the application domain.

## Purpose

### 1. Domain Objects

Models encapsulate the essential data and behavior of entities within the application domain. They represent real-world concepts such as users, products, orders, etc., and define their attributes and relationships.

### 2. Data Integrity

Models enforce data integrity by defining constraints and validations on their attributes. They ensure that data stored in the system conforms to the specified rules and requirements, preventing inconsistencies and errors.

## Example

Consider a User model representing a user entity in the system:

```java
package com.example.domain.models;

public class User {
    private Long id;
    private String username;
    private String email;

    // Constructors, getters, setters, and other methods
}
```
