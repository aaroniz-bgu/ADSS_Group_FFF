# Data Package Documentation

## Overview

The "data" package serves as the repository for database access objects (DAOs) and repositories. These components handle interactions with the database, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and querying data.

## Purpose

### 1. Database Access Objects (DAOs)

DAOs encapsulate the logic for interacting with the database, abstracting away the underlying data access mechanisms. They provide methods for executing database queries, inserting, updating, and deleting records, and handling transactions.

### 2. Repositories

Repositories define interfaces for accessing and managing domain objects in the database. They typically extend Spring Data repositories or custom repository interfaces, providing CRUD operations and query methods for working with domain entities.

### 3. Data Access Logic

The "data" package separates the data access logic from the rest of the application, promoting modularity and maintainability. It encapsulates database-specific code and allows for easy swapping or customization of data access implementations.

## Example

Consider a UserRepository interface defining methods for accessing user-related data:

```java
package com.example.data;

import com.example.models.User;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    User findByUsername(String username);
}
```
